## Learn Terraform - Manage GitHub Users, Teams, and Repository Permissions

This repo is a companion repo to the [Manage GitHub Users, Teams, and Repository Permissions](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/github-user-teams) tutorial, containing configuration files to manage GitHub users, teams and repository permissions.

Congratulations! Over the course of this tutorial, you used Terraform to invite users to your GitHub organization and create new repositories and teams. In the process, you used a wide variety of Terraform's configuration language elements and functions like resource blocks, locals, functions such as csvdecode and format, and learned about the resources the GitHub provider can manage.

By using Terraform to codify your GitHub resources, you can adopt development best practices such as testing, code review, and version control in your GitHub organization management. This configuration adapts to your organization as it scales, enabling your teams to do their best work safely and efficiently.
